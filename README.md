## Tests Run

**Website Tested:** https://www.creditcards.com/
**Pre-Condition:** Access to Chrome Browser

**Test Case:** Footer Link Functionality
**Description/Why:** The footer contains the "fine print" of a website and important links to answer more in depth questions a user may have and provide more specific information on a topic. If the footer links do not function as expected, the business may lose potential new customers and opportunities to resolve issues with clients to build a positive user experience. 
**Expected Result:** The "Contact Us" link should reroute to the "Contact Us" page
**Status:** Pass

**Test Case:** Navbar Functionality
**Description/Why:** The Navbar is where users look to navigate through an entire site and find what they are searching for quickly and efficiently. If the Navbar links do not function as expected, the business will lose possible conversions and returning customers. 
**Expected Result:** The Navbar link should have a dropdown menu with links that will reroute to the specified page upon click
**Status:** Pass

**Test Case:** Image Displayed
**Description/Why:** The credit card image stands out on the page as a user scrolls and helps users identify the product they are being marketed. Users know that the section including this image will have a link or important information regarding the product that they are interested in. 
**Expected Result:** The credit card image should appear upon page load
**Status:** Pass

**Test Case:** Style Test
**Description/Why:** The business has marketing and branding standards that must be followed to maintain a reputable and trusted presence. If styles are not as expected, the consumer may view the site as an untrustworthy source if, for example, headline styles do not match each other or other body text.
**Expected Result:** The headline should have and appear in the correct font-family
**Status:** Pass
